## Welcome to Earth Space Force

In the forgotten maps of ancient times, it was whispered that Earth sits at the heart of a massive, flat realm - **surrounded by lands unknown**, shielded by an icy perimeter no one was allowed to cross.

Invaders from the **Outer Reaches** are breaching the Barrier. Our **fuel reserves**, **communication towers**, and **supply lines** are under attack.

The **Earth Space Force** is activating a new generation of cadets, **you**, to defend the Inner Circle through logic, tactics, and raw mathematical skill.
