# Tactical Alert: Breach Radius Analysis - Earth Space Force Defense Protocol

**Mission Code:** SHIELDNET-34  
**Location:** Outpost Echo-7, Inner Circle Frontier  
**Date:** Post-Fall Cycle 2341

---

### Situation:

An unknown force from the **Outer Continents** has launched an incursion into our sector.

Scout drones detected **2 enemy troop clusters** moving inward.  
Each cluster appears to be surrounded by a **cloaking radius of x kilometers**.

Our intel teams report that the **combined width of both cloaking zones**, plus an extra **3 km dead zone** of disrupted signal interference, equals **11 kilometers** total.

---

### Tactical Challenge:

> **How wide is the cloaking radius (x) around each enemy cluster?**

---

### Strategic Breakdown:

We know:

- **2x** (2 cloaking zones)  
- **+3 km** (dead zone)  
- **= 11 km total interference width**

> **2x + 3 = 11**

You must solve for **x**, the cloaking radius of each enemy cluster.

---

### Your Role:

Your unit is responsible for calibrating the long-range mortars.  
The mortars cannot fire unless the cloaking radius is known, to avoid wasting precious payloads.

If you miscalculate, you risk a failed strike and enemy infiltration.

---

**Solve now. The breach is happening.**

---

# **JS**  
```javascript
// equation: 2x + 3 = 11

let total = 11;
let deadZone = 3;
let clusters = 2;

/* subtract dead zone from total interference width */
let reduced = total - deadZone;

/* divide by number of clusters to isolate x */
let x = reduced / clusters;

console.log("The cloaking radius x is: " + x);

// The cloaking radius x is: 4
````

---

# **PY**

```python
# equation: 2x + 3 = 11

total = 11
dead_zone = 3
clusters = 2

# subtract dead zone from total interference width
reduced = total - dead_zone

# divide by number of clusters to isolate x
x = reduced / clusters

print("The cloaking radius x is:", x)

# The cloaking radius x is: 4
```

---

# 🛰️ SOLVING `2x + 3 = 11`

```
2x + 3 = 11
```

Where:

* 🧲 `2x` = combined cloaking radius from 2 enemy troop clusters
* ⚠️ `+ 3` = additional 3 km signal-dead zone
* 🛰️ `= 11` = total interference width detected by drone scans

We must extract the unknown `x`: the **cloaking radius per enemy cluster**.

---

### 🧩 Step-by-Step Tactical Decryption

#### 🔻 STEP 1: Eliminate the Constant (Dead Zone)

Start with:

```
2x + 3 = 11
```

Subtract **3** from both sides:

```
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
```

Simplifies to:

```
2x = 8
```

> 🎯 Objective 1: Dead zone subtracted. Cloaking radius isolated.

---

#### 🔻 STEP 2: Divide Out the Coefficient (2 Clusters)

Divide both sides by **2**:

```
2x / 2 = 8 / 2
```

Result:

```
x = 4
```

> 🎯 Objective 2: Radius per cluster identified.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

```
x = 4
```

Each **enemy cluster** is surrounded by a **4 km cloaking radius**.

---

### 💡 Tactical Lesson:

To solve `2x + 3 = 11`:

* subtract constants
* isolate the variable
* divide and conquer

> 🧠 *"In war, just like in algebra, clarity crushes chaos."*
