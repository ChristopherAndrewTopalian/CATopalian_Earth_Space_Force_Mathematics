# Tactical Alert: Breach Radius Analysis - Earth Space Force Defense Protocol

**Mission Code:** SHIELDNET-34  
**Location:** Outpost Echo-7, Inner Circle Frontier  
**Date:** Post-Fall Cycle 2341

---

### Situation:

An unknown force from the **Outer Continents** has launched an incursion into our sector.

Scout drones detected **2 enemy troop clusters** moving inward.  
Each cluster appears to be surrounded by a **cloaking radius of x kilometers**.

Our intel teams report that the **combined width of both cloaking zones**, plus an extra **3 km dead zone** of disrupted signal interference, equals **11 kilometers** total.

---

### Tactical Challenge:

> **How wide is the cloaking radius (x) around each enemy cluster?**

---

### Strategic Breakdown:

We know:

- **2x** (2 cloaking zones)  
- **+3 km** (dead zone)  
- **= 11 km total interference width**

> **2x + 3 = 11**

You must solve for **x**, the cloaking radius of each enemy cluster.

---

### Your Role:

Your unit is responsible for calibrating the long range mortars.  
The mortars cannot fire unless the cloaking radius is known, to avoid wasting precious payloads.

If you miscalculate, you risk a failed strike and enemy infiltration.

**Solve now. The breach is happening.**

# **JS**  
```javascript
// equation: 2x + 3 = 11

let total = 11;
let added = 3;
let coefficient = 2;

/* subtract 3 from both sides */
let reduced = total - added;

/* divide by 2 to get x */
let x = reduced / coefficient;

console.log("The value of x is: " + x);

// The value of x is: 4

```

# **PY** 
```python
# equation: 2x + 3 = 11

total = 11
added = 3
coefficient = 2

# subtract 3 from both sides
reduced = total - added

# divide by 2 to get x
x = reduced / coefficient

print("The value of x is:", x)

# The value of x is: 4

```
