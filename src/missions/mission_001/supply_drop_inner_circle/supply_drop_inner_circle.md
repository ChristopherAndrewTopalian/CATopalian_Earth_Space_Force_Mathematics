### 🛰️ Supply Drop: Inner Circle Defense - Earth Space Force Mission Briefing

**Mission Code:** DUSTFIRE-17
**Location:** Sector Theta-4, Inner Circle
**Date:** Post-Fall Cycle 2341

---

### Situation:

Earth is only the **inner circle** of a vast flat realm surrounded by **unknown continents**.

For centuries, our people were taught the outer lands didn't exist. That was a lie.
Now, scouts from the **Outer Reaches** have breached the Barrier.
They're fast, organized, and targeting our antimatter fuel depots.

You are part of **Strike Group Raven**, elite cadets tasked with protecting the Inner Circle.

---

### 🛰️ Mission:

A supply drone was dispatched carrying **4 canisters of antimatter fuel**, each weighing **x grams**.

The drone's systems also include a **fixed frame weight** of **5 grams**.

Command's sensor logs report the **total drone payload** was **16 grams**.

You must figure out:

> ## **What is the weight of one antimatter fuel canister?**

---

### 🧮 Tactical Breakdown:

We know:

* 4 × (fuel canister weight) + drone frame weight = total payload
* aka: **4x + 5 = 16**

Solve the equation to determine **x**, the **mass in grams of each fuel canister**.

---

### 🧠 Your Role:

Before the next drone is cleared to launch toward **Sector Theta-7**, you must upload the correct payload specs.

The **Logistics AI** demands precision. Any error will trigger an auto-abort sequence, cutting off fuel to the outpost.

**Your math is our lifeline.**

**Solve. Launch. Defend Earth.**

# **JS**  
```javascript
// equation: 4x + 5 = 16

let total = 16;
let added = 5;
let coefficient = 4;

// subtract the added value from both sides
let reduced = total - added;

// divide by the coefficient of x
let x = reduced / coefficient;

console.log("The value of x is:", x);

// The value of x is: 2.75
```

---

# **PY**  
```python
# equation: 4x + 5 = 16

total = 16
added = 5
coefficient = 4

# subtract the constant from both sides
reduced = total - added

# divide by the coefficient
x = reduced / coefficient

print("The value of x is:", x)

#The value of x is: 2.75
```
