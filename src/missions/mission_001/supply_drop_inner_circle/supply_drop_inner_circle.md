# Tactical Brief: Inner Circle Supply Drop - Earth Space Force Mission

**Mission Code:** DUSTFIRE-17  
**Location:** Sector Theta-4, Inner Circle  
**Date:** Post-Fall Cycle 2341

---

### Situation:

Earth is the **inner circle** of a vast realm long thought isolated.  
Now we know: **the outer continents are real**, and they are hostile.

Scouts from the **Outer Reaches** have breached the Barrier.  
They are targeting our **antimatter fuel depots** with precision strikes.

You are part of **Strike Group Raven**, tasked with defending the heart of Earth.

---

### Mission Objective:

A supply drone delivered **4 antimatter canisters**, each weighing **x grams**.  
The drone itself has a **fixed frame weight of 5 grams**.  
Sensor logs show the **total payload weight was 16 grams**.

Your task:

> ## **What is the weight of one antimatter fuel canister?**

---

### Tactical Equation:

We know:

- **4x** (mass of 4 canisters)  
- **+ 5** (drone frame)  
- **= 16** (total payload)

This gives us:

> **4x + 5 = 16**

You must solve for **x**, the weight of one canister.

---

### Your Role:

Before the next drone is cleared to deploy to **Sector Theta-7**,  
you must upload the exact payload specs to the Logistics AI.

An error will trigger **mission abort protocols**, severing supply to the frontline.

> Your precision enables victory.

# **JS**  
```javascript
// equation: 4x + 5 = 16

let total = 16;
let added = 5;
let coefficient = 4;

/* subtract 5 from both sides */
let reduced = total - added;

/* divide by 4 to solve for x */
let x = reduced / coefficient;

console.log("The value of x is: " + x);

// The value of x is: 2.75
````

---

# **PY**

```python
# equation: 4x + 5 = 16

total = 16
added = 5
coefficient = 4

# subtract 5 from both sides
reduced = total - added

# divide by 4 to solve for x
x = reduced / coefficient

print("The value of x is:", x)

# The value of x is: 2.75
```

---

# 🛰️ SOLVING `4x + 5 = 16`

```
4x + 5 = 16
```

Where:

* 🧪 `4x` = total mass of **4 identical fuel canisters**
* ⚙️ `+ 5` = drone's frame (fixed weight, 5g)
* 🛰️ `= 16` = full payload confirmed via telemetry

---

### 🧩 Step by Step Tactical Decryption

#### 🔻 STEP 1: Remove the Frame Weight

Start with:

```
4x + 5 = 16
```

Subtract **5** from both sides:

```
4x + 5 - 5 = 16 - 5
```

Simplifies to:

```
4x = 11
```

> 🎯 Objective 1: Frame weight neutralized.

---

#### 🔻 STEP 2: Isolate the Variable

Divide both sides by **4**:

```
4x / 4 = 11 / 4
```

Which results in:

```
x = 2.75
```

> 🎯 Objective 2: Single canister weight confirmed.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

```
x = 2.75
```

Each **antimatter fuel canister** weighs **2.75 grams**.

---

**💡 Tactical Lesson:**
Linear equations are like decoding enemy transmissions -
remove distractions, isolate truth, deliver results.
